## Websites
According to the instructions given, there are two (2) main folders, each with a separate web project.

### 1. Club Website


### 2. On The Limb - Fitness Site
The purpose of the site is to present exercises for persons of varying levels of fitness, all without a cost. It was created as a single page application (SPA), meaning all actions and links taken on the page will take place on the same page. Below are the sections one can expect to find on the website
  
* #### Navigation Bar
The navigation bar is, by default fixed to the left of the screen. It contains four (4) icons, each representing one of the four major sections of the page (which will be       discussed further down).
  
* #### Home
Upon opening the website, the first thing you will see is the home page. It is a slideshow which briefly explains what is being offered on the site.

* #### Exercise
This section contains all the exercises that persons may wish to engage in. It first shows an overview page and a button that reveals the fitness level options that the person   is at. When the appropriate level is selected they will be told who the level is for and a button will lead them to the next step.
When they click this button, they will be given two options for the purpose of their exercise. Whenever an option is selected, their exercise plan will be shown.
