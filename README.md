The purpose of the site is to present exercises for persons of varying levels of fitness, all without a cost. It was created as a single page application (SPA), meaning all actions and links taken on the page will take place on the same page. Below are the sections one can expect to find on the website
  
* #### Navigation Bar
The navigation bar is, by default fixed to the left of the screen. It contains four (4) icons, each representing one of the four major sections of the page (which will be       discussed further down).
  
* #### Home
Upon opening the website, the first thing you will see is the home page. It is a slideshow which briefly explains what is being offered on the site.

* #### Exercise
This section contains all the exercises that persons may wish to engage in. It first shows an overview page and a button that reveals the fitness level options that the person   is at. When the appropriate level is selected they will be told who the level is for and a button will lead them to the next step.
When they click this button, they will be given two options for the purpose of their exercise. Whenever an option is selected, their exercise plan will be shown.

* #### Upcoming Events
The section entails the upcoming events planned for the month of December. We made the dates visible and gave details on the purpose and the venue. It was made also engaging as they just had to hover over the date to see a pop up of the scheduled event and all things pertaining to that particular upcoming event. For ever month that the website would have new activites the site would be updated to that particular month. 

* #### About Us
This was just to give information on the site, to let the visitors who use our platform to know what we are about. It gives information on our organization, where to find us on social media, ways to donate and most critical, the disclaimer tp prevent injury to any user and stay clear of lawsuits. If transactions were to be made ot the site, their card information would not be stored nor remembered by the site. Their financial idenity would be safe.
